    <h1>SPORTING CP</h1>
    <p>At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, who was impressed with his dribbling.[27] He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.[19] A year later, on 29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, against Braga and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3–0 win.[28] Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta.[29] Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer.[30]

    <p>Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade in August 2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year.[31] Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting £12.24 million[31] for what he considered to be "one of the most exciting young players" he had ever seen.[32] A decade after his departure from the club, in April 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member.[33]</p>

    <h3>2003–2007: Development and breakthrough</h3>
    <p>
        Ronaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003–04 season, and made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club.[35] His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history.[36] Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.[37] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.[38] A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career."[39]

        Ronaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4–0 home win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August 2003, and received a standing ovation when he came on for Nicky Butt.[40] His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as "undoubtedly the most exciting debut" he had ever seen.[34] Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November.[41] Three more league goals followed in the second half of the campaign,[42] the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received the first red card of his career.[43] Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United's 3–0 win over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final, earning his first trophy.[44] BBC pundit Alan Hansen described him as the star of the final.[45] The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his "elaborate" step-overs in trying to beat opponents,[46] but teammate Gary Neville said he was "not a show pony, but the real thing", and predicted he would become a world-class player.[47]

        <h1>Real Madrid</h1>
        <p>Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time of £80 million (€94 million).[112] His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11 million per year and contained a €1 billion buy-out clause.[113] At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli.[114] Since club captain Raúl already wore the number 7 (the number Ronaldo wore at United), Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt,[115] which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.</p>
        <h3>2009–2013: World record transfer and La Liga title</h3>
        <p>Ronaldo made his La Liga debut against Deportivo La Coruña on 29 August, scoring a penalty in a 3–2 home win.[117] He scored in each of his first four league games, the first Madrid player to do so.[118] His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Zürich.[119] His strong start to the season was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks.[120][121] A week after his return, he received his first red card in Spain in a match against Almería.[122] Midway through the season, Ronaldo finished second in the 2009 Ballon d'Or and the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year awards, behind Messi. He finished the season with 33 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick in a 4–1 win against Mallorca on 5 May 2010, his first in La Liga,[123][124] and became Real Madrid's highest goalscorer that season. Although Ronaldo helped amass a club record 96 points in the league, he did not win a trophy in his first season</p>
